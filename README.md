> **CSR-focused • Self-hostable • Opinionated**

Reno Stack is a modern web app starter kit designed for speed, efficiency, and self-hosting.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚛️ **React App with Vite** – Fast and reliable
- 🚦 **Tanstack Router** – File-based routing
- 🔐 **Better-Auth** – Simple authentication
- 🎨 **Tailwind + Shadcn** – Quick UI building
- 🔗 **Type-safe DX** – End-to-end type safety
- 🛠️ **Self-hostable** – Everything is self-hostable
- 🧩 **Drizzle ORM** – Modern, type-safe ORM
- 📦 **PNPM** – Efficient package management

## Quick Start

Before diving in, it's recommended to read the sections below for a better understanding of the stack. Here's how to run the example app:

| Command                | Description                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pnpm i`               | Install dependencies                |
| `cp .env.example .env` | Configure environment variables     |
| `pnpm db:push`         | Push Drizzle schema to the database |

Create a Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Go to your created application and add the following to `Redirects` in `OAuth2` settings:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback/discord
```

Add `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` to `.env`. If you change the server's port, update `VITE_SERVER_URL` and the redirect URI.

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to start building! 🚀

## Type-safety

Reno Stack uses [Hono RPC](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc) for type-safety, integrated with React Query through a [custom utility](https://github.com/reno-stack/hono-react-query). Use `createHonoQueryOptions` and `createHonoMutationOptions` for reusable query and mutation options.

Example for a `notes` route:

```typescript
import { client } from "../utils/hono-client";
import {
  createHonoQueryOptions,
  createHonoMutationOptions,
} from "@reno-stack/hono-react-query";

export const notesQueryOptions = createHonoQueryOptions(
  ["notes"],
  client.notes.$get
);
export const noteByIdQueryOptions = createHonoQueryOptions(
  ({ param: { id } }) => ["notes", id],
  client.notes[":id"].$get
);
export const createNoteMutationOptions = createHonoMutationOptions(
  client.notes.$post
);
```

Use them like this:

```typescript
const notesQuery = useQuery(notesQueryOptions());
```

Or in case of a query with parameters:

```typescript
const noteByIdQuery = useQuery(
  noteByIdQueryOptions({ param: { id } }, { enabled: !!id })
);
```

Invalidate queries safely:

```typescript
await queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: notesQueryOptions().queryKey });
```

Simple as that! all the type safety and error handling are done by the utility.

If you want more information about the utility or why you might need it, check out the [hono-react-query repository](https://github.com/reno-stack/hono-react-query).

## Database

Reno Stack uses Drizzle with PostgreSQL. Set your environment variables in `.env` and run `pnpm db:push` to apply migrations. Use `pnpm db:studio` to view the database schema and data.

## Authentication

It's highly recommended that you check out [Better-Auth's documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/introduction) for learning more about the library.

In short, you have a default schema file (`auth-schema.ts`) in the server app that is generated by Better-Auth and a main entry point called `auth.ts`. You can add any strategies that you want such as OAuth2 (Reno Stack's example comes with a Discord OAuth integration), email and password, OTP, etc

Reno Stack comes with a `withAuth` middleware that you could use in any of your routes/group of routes. Example usage of a simple `notes` router:

```typescript
export const notes = new Hono<HonoAppContext>()
	.post("/", zValidator("json", createNotesSchema), withAuth, async (c) => {
	const  user = c.var.user;
	const { title, content } = await c.req.valid("json");
	// ...
```

## Creating Routes and Components

Use these commands to create new routes and components:

| Command                    | Description                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `pnpm create:route <name>` | \* Create a new server route  |
| `pnpm ui-add <name>`       | Add UI components from Shadcn |

- Note \*: For creating a client route, please follow the instructions [here](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/file-based-routing).

## Motivation

Reno Stack is heavily inspired by [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and it's [Turborepo template](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo), but it takes a different approach to building full-stack web applications. Unlike setups where Next.js handles both the API and client, Reno Stack decouples these components. The frontend is a React application powered by Vite, while the backend is a Hono-powered server. They communicate through type-safe API calls, allowing for faster iteration and a more streamlined development process.

While there is ongoing debate about client-side rendering (CSR) being worse or on par with server-side rendering (SSR) in terms of SEO, Reno Stack is particularly suited for applications where SEO is not a primary concern. This is because features like SSG and SSR are not enabled by default (although they can be added, they're just not in the template at this moment). This approach makes Reno Stack an ideal choice for projects that prioritize speed and simplicity over SEO optimization.

## Future Plans

Plans include a CLI tool for generating projects with different technologies.
